MY project is a primitive automate ( build to illustrate the basics of this strategy) focuses on trading Forex market using Pairs Trading techniques to look in a dynamically and continuously way for the best co-integrate couple then open & close positions depending on the value of the Z-score.
this is a first application to what i have been learned in this field trough books,articles and lectures in purpose to get familiarized with statistical arbitrage techniques and building trading systems but also to develop my programming skills for that i preferred to create my own Trade class instead of using Fxcm's class.
I hope that reading this Source Code will be as useful for you as building it was for me.
